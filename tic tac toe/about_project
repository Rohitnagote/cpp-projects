A Tic Tac Toe project in C++ is a classic console-based game that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, 
including arrays, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. 
The game provides an interactive experience where two players (or a player and the computer) compete to align three of their symbols in a row,
column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid.

 **Project Overview**

The Tic Tac Toe game in C++ typically features:
- A 3x3 board displayed in the console using simple text graphics.
- Two modes: single-player (against a basic AI) and two-player (both human players).
- Turn-based gameplay, where players alternate marking their chosen cell with 'X' or 'O'.
- Input validation to prevent overwriting already marked cells.
- Win, draw, and ongoing game condition checks after each move.
- Optionally, a scoring system, timed moves, or game history tracking.

## **Technical Features**

- **Board Representation:**  
The board is implemented as a 3x3 two-dimensional array of characters. 
Each cell initially contains a number (for easy selection), which gets replaced by 'X' or 'O' as players make their moves.

- **Game Logic:**  
  Functions are used to:
  - Display the board after each move.
  - Accept and validate player input.
  - Check for win or draw conditions after every turn.
  - Switch turns between players.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
More advanced implementations use classes for players and the game itself, 
encapsulating data and behavior for better code organization and reusability.


 **Learning Outcomes**

Building a Tic Tac Toe game in C++ helps developers:
- Understand and apply arrays, loops, and conditional statements.
- Practice function decomposition and code modularity.
- Gain experience with object-oriented programming (classes, encapsulation).
- Implement basic file handling for saving game history or scores.
