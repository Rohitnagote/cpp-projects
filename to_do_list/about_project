A To-Do List project in C++ is a practical, console-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently.
This project typically demonstrates core C++ programming concepts, including data structures,
object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interface design.

  **Project Overview**

The To-Do List application allows users to:
- Add new tasks with details such as description and priority.
- View all tasks in a structured format.
- Update existing tasks (e.g., edit description or change completion status).
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Search for tasks by name or priority.
- Save and load tasks from a file to ensure data persistence across sessions.

 **Technical Features**

- **Data Structures:** 
  - Tasks are typically represented using structs or classes, containing fields like description, priority, and completion status.
  - A vector (std::vector) is commonly used for dynamic storage of tasks, enabling the list to grow or shrink as needed.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**
  - The logic is encapsulated in a ToDoList class, which manages adding, displaying, updating, removing, and marking tasks as complete.

- **File Handling:**
  - Tasks are saved to and loaded from a file (e.g., "list.txt"), ensuring that user data is not lost between sessions.

- **User Interface:**
  - The application features a menu-driven console interface, allowing users to interact with the program through simple numbered choices.
  - Input validation and clear prompts make the application user-friendly.


 **Why This Project is Useful**

This project not only helps users organize their tasks but also serves as an excellent learning tool for C++ developers. 
It covers essential programming concepts such as:
- Structs and classes for data organization.
- Vectors for dynamic memory management.
- File I/O for persistent storage.
- Control flow and menu-driven logic for user interaction.
